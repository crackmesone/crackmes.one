        <h3 id="where-am-i">Where am I? <a href="#where-am-i" class="anchor-link">#</a></h3>
        <p>Crackmes.de does not exist anymore. This site was created as a place for reverse engineers to upload their creations and help newcomers learn this discipline. Here you can improve your reversing skills by downloading crackmes and submitting writeups to them.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3 id="what-is-crackme">What is a crackme? <a href="#what-is-crackme" class="anchor-link">#</a></h3>
        <p>A crackme is a small program designed specifically to be reverse engineered and "cracked" as an educational exercise. Unlike real software, crackmes are purposefully created with challenges such as password validation, serial number checking, or anti-debugging techniques to help you practice reverse engineering skills. Common goals include finding the correct password, generating valid serial keys, or bypassing authentication checks. Crackmes are legal and ethical because they are made specifically for this purpose.</p>

        <h3 id="what-is-writeup">What is a writeup? <a href="#what-is-writeup" class="anchor-link">#</a></h3>
        <p>A writeup is a detailed explanation of how you solved a crackme. It should document your thought process, the tools you used, the techniques you applied, and the steps you took to find the solution. A good writeup helps others learn from your approach and demonstrates your understanding of reverse engineering concepts. Writeups can be in text, markdown, HTML, PDF, or even video format. Simply providing a keygen script without explanation is not considered a valid writeup.</p>

        <h3 id="what-tools">What tools do I need to solve crackmes? <a href="#what-tools" class="anchor-link">#</a></h3>
        <p>You will need reverse engineering tools to analyze and solve crackmes. Here are some commonly used tools:</p>

        <h3 id="is-this-legal">Is this legal? <a href="#is-this-legal" class="anchor-link">#</a></h3>
        <p>Obviously, all crackmes available on this website have been made to be cracked.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3 id="not-allowed">What content is not allowed on this site? <a href="#not-allowed" class="anchor-link">#</a></h3>
        <p>This website is dedicated to educational reverse engineering challenges (crackmes) only. The following types of content are <b>strictly prohibited</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Game cracking, cheating, or modding</b> - Cracks, trainers, or modifications for commercial or indie games</li>
            <li><b>Commercial software cracking or DRM circumvention</b> - Keygens, patches, or license circumvention for paid software</li>
            <li><b>Malware or viruses</b> - Real malicious software (crackmes with simulated malware behavior for educational purposes are acceptable if clearly labeled)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Submissions violating these rules will be rejected and may result in account suspension. This site is for learning reverse engineering through purpose-built educational challenges only.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3 id="password-protected">I downloaded a crackme but it's password-protected. <a href="#password-protected" class="anchor-link">#</a></h3>
        <p>The password for the files is "<b>crackmes.one</b>". If it does not work, this is probably because the crackme has been imported from crackmes.de, so use the password "<b>crackmes.de</b>" instead.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3 id="submission-not-appearing">I submitted a crackme/writeup but it does not appear on the website. <a href="#submission-not-appearing" class="anchor-link">#</a></h3>
        <p>Every crackme and writeup is validated before appearing on the website. This may take anywhere from a few hours to a couple of days.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3 id="no-information">Some crackmes do not have any information. <a href="#no-information" class="anchor-link">#</a></h3>
        <p>Indeed, but in most cases there is a README or instructions file within the archive.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3 id="submit-writeup">How can I submit a writeup? <a href="#submit-writeup" class="anchor-link">#</a></h3>
        <p>First, you must login or register for an account. Then, you can upload your writeup on the crackme page. Text, markdown, HTML, and similar formats are preferred, but if you think that a video will be clearer, feel free to upload it!</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3 id="course-material">Can I use these crackmes as free course material? <a href="#course-material" class="anchor-link">#</a></h3>
        <p>Please feel free to use crackmes available on this site for non-commercial purposes, but please mention the author.</p>
        <p>If you are using more than 99 crackmes for any purpose, please let us know via crackmesone@gmail.com.</p>
        <p>Unauthorized mirroring of the website contents (including the crackmes) is not allowed without explicit permission.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3 id="writeup-rejected">My writeup does not appear on the website after many days! <a href="#writeup-rejected" class="anchor-link">#</a></h3>
        <p>This is probably because your writeup was rejected. Please upload a detailed explanation of how you solved the crackme, not just a simple keygen script. Additionally, there is one important rule: <b>don't patch!</b> Unless the author explicitly stated that patching is a valid solution, you should write a keygen and document your process. You will learn more by doing this.</p>

        <p>This site was created with love for reverse engineering by <a href="https://twitter.com/sar5430" target="_blank">sar</a> using the <a href="https://github.com/josephspurrier/gowebapp">gowebapp</a> framework. The design was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/mpgn_x64" target="_blank">Bonclay</a>, inspired by <a href="https://hackthebox.eu" target="_blank">hackthebox.eu</a>.</p>
        <p>In March 2025, sar stepped down and <a href="https://xusheng.dev/" target="_blank">Xusheng Li</a> became the new site admin.</p>
