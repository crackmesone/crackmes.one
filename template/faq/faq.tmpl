        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <h3>Where am i?</h3>
        <p>Crackmes.de does not exists anymore. Reversers need to find a place to upload their creation and help new people to learn from that great discipline. This place has been made in order to help you to improve your reversing skills. You can download some crackmes and submit writeups to them.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3>Is this legal?</h3>
        <p>Obviously, all crackmes available on this website have been made to be cracked.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3>I downloaded a crackme but it's password-protected.</h3>
        <p>The password for the files is "<b>crackmes.one</b>". If it does not work, this is probably because the crackme has been imported from crackmes.de, so use the password "<b>crackmes.de</b>" instead.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3>I submitted a crackme/writeup but it does not appear on the website.</h3>
        <p>Every crackme/writeup is validated before appearing on the website. This may take anywhere from a few hours to a couple of days</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3>Some crackmes does not have any kind of information.</h3>
        <p>Indeed, but in most cases there's a README/instructions file within the archive.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3>How can I submit a writeup.</h3>
        <p>First, you must login/register. Then, you can upload your writeup on the crackme page. Text, markdown, HTML, and similar formats are preferred, but if you think that a video will be clearer, feel free to upload it!</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3>Can I use those crackmes as free course material?</h3>
        <p>Please feel free to use crackmes available on this site for non-commercial purposes. But please mention the author. :)</p>
        <p>If you are using more than 99 crackmes for any purposes, please let us know via crackmesone@gmail.com.</p>
        <p>Unauthorized mirroring of the website contents (including the crackmes) are not allowed without explicit permission.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3>My writeup does not appear on the website after many days!</h3>
        <p>This is probably because your writeup got rejected. Please, upload an explanation of how you managed to solve the crackme, not just a simple keygen.py file. More generally there's only one rule: don't patch! Unless the author explicitly said that patching is a valid solution, don't do it. Write your keygen, write your writeup. You'll learn more by doing this.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3>How do I create a good writeup?</h3>
        <p>Please refer to the writeup <a href=/upload/writeuprules>submission rules</a>.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3>How do I reset my password?</h3>
        <p>If you still remember your password, first log in, click "Profile", then at the bottom of the profile page, click "Change Password", and then provide your current and new password.</p>
        <p>If you do not remember your current password, please email crackmesone@gmail.com from the email you used when you registered the account for help.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3>How do I delete my account?</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately we have not yet implemented the workflow for deleting an account. However, please feel free to email us so that we do delete your account when we implement that.</p>
