        <p>Crackmes.de does not exist anymore. This site was created as a place for reverse engineers to upload their creations and help newcomers learn this discipline. Here you can improve your reversing skills by downloading crackmes and submitting writeups to them.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3 id="what-is-crackme">What is a crackme? <a href="#what-is-crackme" class="anchor-link">#</a></h3>
        <p>A crackme is a small program designed specifically to be reverse engineered and "cracked" as an educational exercise. Unlike real software, crackmes are purposefully created with challenges such as password validation, serial number checking, or anti-debugging techniques to help you practice reverse engineering skills. Common goals include finding the correct password, generating valid serial keys, or bypassing authentication checks. Crackmes are legal and ethical because they are made specifically for this purpose.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3 id="what-is-writeup">What is a writeup? <a href="#what-is-writeup" class="anchor-link">#</a></h3>
        <p>A writeup is a detailed explanation of how you solved a crackme. It should document your thought process, the tools you used, the techniques you applied, and the steps you took to find the solution. A good writeup helps others learn from your approach and demonstrates your understanding of reverse engineering concepts. Writeups can be in text, markdown, HTML, PDF, or even video format. Simply providing a keygen script without explanation is not considered a valid writeup.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3 id="what-tools">What tools do I need to solve crackmes? <a href="#what-tools" class="anchor-link">#</a></h3>

        <h3 id="is-this-legal">Is this legal? <a href="#is-this-legal" class="anchor-link">#</a></h3>
        <p>Obviously, all crackmes available on this website have been made to be cracked.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3 id="not-allowed">What content is not allowed on this site? <a href="#not-allowed" class="anchor-link">#</a></h3>
        <p>This website is dedicated to educational reverse engineering challenges (crackmes) only. The following types of content are <b>strictly prohibited</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Game cracking, cheating, or modding</b> - Cracks, trainers, or modifications for commercial or indie games</li>
            <li><b>Commercial software cracking or DRM circumvention</b> - Keygens, patches, or license circumvention for paid software</li>
            <li><b>Malware or viruses</b> - Real malicious software (crackmes with simulated malware behavior for educational purposes are acceptable if clearly labeled)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Submissions violating these rules will be rejected and may result in account suspension. This site is for learning reverse engineering through purpose-built educational challenges only.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3 id="password-protected">I downloaded a crackme but it's password-protected. <a href="#password-protected" class="anchor-link">#</a></h3>
        <p>The password for the files is "<b>crackmes.one</b>". If it does not work, this is probably because the crackme has been imported from crackmes.de, so use the password "<b>crackmes.de</b>" instead.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3 id="submission-not-appearing">I submitted a crackme/writeup but it does not appear on the website. <a href="#submission-not-appearing" class="anchor-link">#</a></h3>
        <p>Every crackme and writeup is validated before appearing on the website. This may take anywhere from a few hours to a couple of days.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3 id="no-information">Some crackmes do not have any information. <a href="#no-information" class="anchor-link">#</a></h3>
        <p>Indeed, but in most cases there is a README or instructions file within the archive.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3 id="submit-writeup">How do I submit a writeup? <a href="#submit-writeup" class="anchor-link">#</a></h3>
        <p>First, you must login or register for an account. Then, navigate to the crackme page and upload your writeup there.</p>
        <p><b>Accepted formats:</b> Text, markdown, HTML, PDF, and similar formats are preferred.</p>
        <p><b>Important rule:</b> Don't patch! Unless the author explicitly stated that patching is a valid solution, you should write a keygen and document your process. You will learn more by doing this.</p>
        <p>For complete guidelines, see the <a href="/upload/writeuprules">writeup submission rules</a>.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3 id="writeup-rejected">Why was my writeup rejected? <a href="#writeup-rejected" class="anchor-link">#</a></h3>
        <p>Writeups are rejected if they don't meet our submission standards. Common reasons include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Only providing a password, serial, key, or executable without explanation</li>
            <li>Patching the binary when the expected solution is to keygen or find the password</li>
            <li>Insufficient detail about the solving process</li>
            <li>Password-protected archive (server handles this automatically)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Review the <a href="/upload/writeuprules">writeup submission rules</a>, improve your writeup with detailed explanations, and resubmit. Remember: we want others to learn from your solution!</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3 id="what-is-patching">What is patching and why is it not allowed? <a href="#what-is-patching" class="anchor-link">#</a></h3>
        <p><b>Patching</b> means modifying the binary executable to bypass its protection mechanisms, typically by changing conditional jumps (e.g., replacing <code>JNZ</code> with <code>JZ</code>) or <code>NOP</code>-ing out instructions to skip validation checks entirely.</p>
        <p>Patching is generally <b>not considered a valid solution</b> for crackmes because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Crackmes are about understanding algorithms:</b> The core purpose of a crackme is to analyze the validation logic and determine the correct input (password, serial key, etc.) that satisfies the check. Patching bypasses this learning entirely.</li>
            <li><b>Limited educational value:</b> While patching demonstrates basic binary modification skills, it doesn't teach you how the algorithm works, how to reverse engineer the key generation logic, or how to write a keygen.</li>
            <li><b>Writeups should help others learn:</b> A writeup that only shows "change byte X to Y" provides little insight compared to one that explains the algorithm and derives the solution mathematically or programmatically.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Note:</b> Even if a crackme author states that patching is allowed, reviewers may still reject patch-only writeups because they make little contribution to the community's learning. If you do patch, consider also explaining the algorithm and providing a keygen alongside your patch.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3 id="submit-crackme">How do I submit a crackme? <a href="#submit-crackme" class="anchor-link">#</a></h3>
        <p>To submit a crackme, you must first login or register. Then go to the <a href="/upload/crackme">Upload Crackme</a> page. Make sure to read the <a href="/upload/crackmerules">crackme submission rules</a> before uploading to ensure your submission meets the requirements.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3 id="crackme-rejected">Why was my crackme rejected? <a href="#crackme-rejected" class="anchor-link">#</a></h3>
        <p>Crackmes are rejected for violating our submission rules. Common reasons include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not original work (copied from elsewhere without permission)</li>
            <li>Using commercial packers/protectors like Themida or VMProtect</li>
            <li>Fails to execute, crashes, or has missing dependencies</li>
            <li>Makes network connections to external servers</li>
            <li>Unclear how to provide input or what constitutes a solution</li>
            <li>Requires excessive guessing or brute-forcing</li>
            <li>Contains actual malware or relies on hardware unique identifiers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Review the complete <a href="/upload/crackmerules">crackme submission rules</a>, fix the issues, and resubmit. If you're unsure why your crackme was rejected, contact us at crackmesone@gmail.com.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3 id="upload-size-limit">What is the maximum file size for uploads? <a href="#upload-size-limit" class="anchor-link">#</a></h3>
        <p>The maximum file size for both crackme and writeup uploads is <b>5 MB</b> (5,000,000 bytes). If you need to include additional files or resources, compress them into a single archive. Do not password-protect your archive - the server handles compression and password protection automatically.</p>
